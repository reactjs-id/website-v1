Got any talk ideas for the next meetup? Submit your proposals in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/reactjs-id/meetup).

## Talk proposal process

We're following the system used by [JakartaJS](https://github.com/jakartajs/talks) of using GitHub. To propose your idea, [create an issue](https://github.com/reactjs-id/meetup/issues/new) following the template provided. We will then review your proposal, and if you're lucky, we will confirm a schedule with you for the next meetup.

We have two kinds of talks:

- Lightning Talk (5-15min)
- Full Talk (30-45min)

Note that lightning talks are informal, so feel free to step up in the stage anytime we announce the start of a lightning talk session during our meetups.

## Preparing for your talk

If this is your first time giving out a talk, you can learn some tips and tricks on giving a really good talk. [speaking.io](https://speaking.io/) is a good place to start.

Note that in most venues we will only provide a handheld mic and not a lapel or headset mic, so practice presenting while holding a mic.
